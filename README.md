# Warehouse Network Optimization 

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing the warehouse working process with the
objective of reducing total work shift time. A step-by-step optimization
approach is applied, starting from time calculation of the existing system
to restructuring worker movement and material handling methods.

---

## Optimization Process
The optimization was carried out in multiple stages, resulting in a
continuous reduction of work shift time across iterations.

---

## Main Work Stages

1. **Time calculation of initial work shift**  
   Analysis of the baseline warehouse work shift to determine total time
   consumption and identify inefficiencies.

2. **Creating a simulation model of work shift**  
   Development of a simulation model to imitate real warehouse operations
   and worker movement.

3. **Relocation of workers by floors**  
   Optimizing worker allocation across different floors to minimize travel
   time.

4. **Relocation of workers by waves**  
   Restructuring work allocation based on order waves to improve task
   synchronization.

5. **Reformation of carts**  
   Optimization of cart structure and usage to improve handling efficiency.

6. **Reformation of boxes**  
   Redesigning box arrangement to reduce unnecessary movements and handling
   delays.
